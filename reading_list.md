# Why?
We often get questions about what to read, study, or otherwise to prepare for the things this club does. While we definately do not have a "base minimum requirement" for what you need to know to dive in, the following materials are recommended to every member of our organization.

## Basic Knowledge
These materials are considered "basic foundation" and every skilled member of our organization should at least know the base terms and vocabulary contained here. It gives us a common language to share solutions, make plans, and helps us punch search terms into Google mid-competition.

## Intermediate General Knowledge
Already know how to port scan, but stuck in the GUI? A good teammate is intimately familiar with the command line interface. It's just a lot faster. At this point, you need to get more familiar with general tactics and strategies, and develop common-skills that will keep you oriented in Linux and Windows Server environments.
