To all Employees,

This is the current password policy put in place by request of the administration. In order to keep our company secure, we require that all employees follow this mandatory password policy. The password must be at least 8 characters in length. The password must not contain your name, username, company, or any other associated name used by you. The password must be different from any previously used passwords. This is to ensure that if one account is compromised, the extent of the incident is isolated. 
	One technique for having a secure password is to refrain from using a world spelled completely. Common words used in passwords make it an easy target. Another requirement is that the password must contain at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one number, and one special character. Do not put special characters in obvious places (e.g. short, $hort).
